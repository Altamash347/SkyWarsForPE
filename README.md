# SkyWarsForPE

## Introduction
SkyWarsForPE is a plugin build for HyrulePE minigames, this source has been moved to open sourced again due to some inactivity in project, as the result, this plugin will be continued to compete
with other SkyWars plugin. I ensure you, this plugin is more powerful than ever before. Powered by PHP.

This is the server of the HyrulePE which I collaborated with:
